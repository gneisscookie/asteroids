# Asteroids

A visualization of known and tracked Near Earth Asteroids, or NEAs that will make a close approach to Earth within the next 12 months, or have made a close approach within the last 12 months, as tracked by NASA's JPL NEO program.
Many NEAs aren't discovered until they've nearly passed us in their orbit of the sun, which is why one side of this graph is so much more populated than the other. The view in our rear-view mirror is better than the one through our windsheild.
